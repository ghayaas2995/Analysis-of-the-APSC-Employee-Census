# Statistical-Analysis-of-the-APSC-Employee-Census

The consensuses include demographics, scored questions and response questions in Likert scale format (1 - Strongly agree to 5 - Strongly disagree) regarding the APS employee's experience and feelings in the agency. The goal of the analysis is to find statistical relationships or differences using A/B testing on the survey data of Australian Public Service Commission for the years 2014 and 2020 to draw conclusions on overall employee satisfaction.

I performed a range of non parametric statistical tests like Mann whitney, Kruskal wallis, Anova tests and pair wise adhoc tests on the survey questionnaire to determine the effect of gender, agency size and several other demographic factors with employeeâ€™s work pressure, communication with supervisors, remuneration, non-monetary benefits, and unethical behaviors at work places including discrimination, harassment and bullying. 

This analysis also identifies the leadership styles which can be used to predict employees that strive for creativity and innovation within the APS agencies. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and correspondence analysis (CA), this study identified the leadership styles as coaching, transformation, and consideration. From the result, EFA successfully determined that the employees were influenced by only the motivational characters and the considerate characters of the leaders in agencies which is related to the consideration leadership style. This analysis recommends APS to continue implementing newer training and learning programs and use the coaching leadership style as it found to significantly impact the employees that strive for creativity and innovation at their workplace
