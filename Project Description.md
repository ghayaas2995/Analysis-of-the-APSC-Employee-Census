# Statistical-Analysis-of-the-APSC-Employee-Census

•	Mapped variables of interest common in both year’s censes to analyze their affect on overall employee satisfaction by comparing work pressure on employees, their monetary and non-monetary compensations, and unethical behaviors at workplaces against different demographical factors like, age, sex, and agency size

•	Performed appropriate statistical one sided and two sided non parametric tests like Mann Whitney test, Kruskal Wallis test, chi square test, and pair wise post hoc tests to determine statistical relationships and strength of relationship between the demographical factors like age of employees, gender, agency size with employee’s work pressure, communication with supervisors, remuneration, non-monetary benefits, and unethical behaviors at work places including discrimination, harassment, bullying considering the statistical assumptions of these tests on Likert scale data

•	Lead a team of 3 students from Langara College, Vancouver, through the project and delivered a team presentation discussing the results and conclusions from the statistical analysis on the effects of employee demographics on employee satisfaction in the form of storytelling using Tableau dashboards

•	Determined hidden patterns and factors affecting the working conditions of the employees, determined differences in the work pressure, remuneration, non-monetary benefits, discrimination, harassment, bullying in employees of different age groups, agency sizes and gender and presented recommendations based on the inferences
